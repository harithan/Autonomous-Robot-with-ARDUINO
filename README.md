Autonomous-Robot-with-ARDUINO
=============================

The source code is written in embedded C 

=====

The source code is divided into two files the first file can be burnt directly in the MC but, will suffer serious drawbacks when the rotora draw more amps that that of the bridges can supply.

The second code has a time delay which would is meant to preserve the resis tanceof the motors

The pin config can be identified by the variables used in the code. but the analog output needs tweaking based on the SONAR OR PROXIMITY used on the board
